BlockChain Files:

blockchain/: This directory contains all the components related to the Ethereum smart contracts and the deployment scripts.
    contracts/: Solidity smart contracts (like NFTAuction.sol for the auction logic).
        Migrations.sol Contract (in contracts/ folder):

        This is a Solidity contract that Truffle uses to keep track of which migrations have been executed.
        The contract contains functions to set and retrieve the last completed migration step.
        It's part of the smart contract system and, like other contracts, gets compiled and deployed. Hence, it resides in the contracts/ folder.
        Migration Scripts (in migrations/ folder):

        These are JavaScript files that Truffle uses to deploy contracts to the Ethereum blockchain.
        Each file in the migrations/ folder represents a step in the deployment process, and these scripts interact with the Ethereum network to deploy your contracts.
        The scripts also interact with the Migrations.sol contract to record the progress of the deployment.

test/: Tests for your smart contracts.
truffle-config.js: Configuration file for Truffle.
